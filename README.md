#jlox Interpreter

This is the implementation of the jlox interpreter from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This README is mainly to take notes while I read the book.

### Compilers in general

* [Reference to computer science text book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html#regular-languages-and-expressions): the [dragon book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools)

### Lexing

* [Handling longer lexems and lookahead](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html#longer-lexemes)

### Error handling

* [On the location of the errors](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html#location-information): "Some token implementations store the location as two numbers: the offset from the beginning of
the source file to the beginning of the lexeme, and the length of the lexeme. The scanner needs to
know these anyway, so thereâ€™s no overhead to calculate them."

* [Reporting all errors](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html#lexical-errors): "Note also that we keep scanning. There may be other errors later in the program."

### Programming

* [static imports considered bad style](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html#the-scanner-class)
* [Ternary as a function argument](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html#operators): `addToken(match('=') ? BANG_EQUAL : BANG);`
